Personal Portfolio built with Astro and Tailwind. Hello! I'm a Front-End Developer with experience in UI/UX design and web development. I use tools like Figma, SASS, Angular, React, and more. I'm passionate about quality, creativity, and accessibility. I'm ready to bring value to exceptional projects. Let's make it happen together!

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a modern component-driven architecture:

- **src/components** – reusable UI building blocks organized by atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms, layouts).
- **src/features** – self-contained features that bundle UI and logic such as the theme switcher.
- **src/lib** – shared utilities and API helpers.
